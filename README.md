## 🎮 What Is This?

**One Night at Elektryk** is a very basic Five Nights at Freddy’s-style game written in Python using Pygame. It was built with simplicity and customization in mind.  
The game is meant to be **easily modified**: just replace a few images in the `assets/` folder, and boom — you've got your own FNaF-style game featuring your teacher, boss, or even your cat.

The included version features **Dariusz Baj** — an animatronic inspired by a real-life character from the legendary halls of Elektryk.
